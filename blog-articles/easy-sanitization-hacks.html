    <p>
      Running a small business in Highland’s busy retail scene comes with a challenge: keeping your space sanitized.
      With 56,400 residents flocking to local shops and eateries, high-touch surfaces like counters, door handles, and restrooms can become germ hotspots.
      A clean store isn’t just about looks—it builds customer trust and keeps staff healthy.
      Don’t have hours to deep clean? Here are three eco-friendly sanitization hacks you can do in minutes, plus a pro tip to make your Highland business shine.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl">Hack 1: Castile Soap for Sparkling Counters</h2>
    <p>
      High foot traffic in Highland’s strip malls leaves counters dusty and sticky.
      Grab liquid castile soap, a plant-based cleaner safe for all surfaces.
      Mix one tablespoon with a quart of warm water in a spray bottle.
      Spritz your counters, cash registers, and display cases, then wipe with a microfiber cloth.
      It cuts through grime without harsh chemicals, perfect for the 30% of Inland Empire customers who love green cleaning.
      Do this daily for a spotless first impression.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl">Hack 2: Tea Tree Oil Spray for Door Handles</h2>
    <p>
      Door handles and light switches are germ magnets in busy shops.
      Make a natural disinfectant with tea tree oil, known for its antibacterial power.
      Add 10 drops to a cup of water in a small spray bottle.
      Shake well, then mist handles, card readers, and restroom faucets.
      Wipe with a clean cloth.
      This quick trick, done twice daily, keeps germs at bay and leaves a fresh scent customers notice.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl">Hack 3: Daily Cloth Refresh for Restrooms</h2>
    <p>
      Restrooms in Highland businesses see heavy use, and reusable cloths can spread germs if not cleaned.
      After wiping down sinks and toilets with your castile soap mix, toss cloths in a bucket of hot water with a splash of vinegar.
      Soak for 10 minutes, then machine-wash.
      This ensures fresh cloths daily, reducing odors and health risks.
      It’s a simple step that makes your restroom feel welcoming.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl">Why These Hacks Work</h2>
    <p>
      These solutions are fast, affordable, and eco-friendly, fitting the needs of Highland’s small businesses.
      Castile soap and tea tree oil are non-toxic, protecting staff and customers, while the cloth refresh saves money on disposables.
      Together, they tackle the 20% rise in commercial cleaning demand (IBISWorld, 2025) without eating into your day.
      But if time’s tight or you need a deeper clean, professional help can take it to the next level.
